Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6 Results\\n6.1 Machine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

An embedding is a process that \\nturns a high-dimensional complex thing into a lower-dimensional more easily workable thing. It’s a \\nmathematical idea. Embeddings are basic tools in topology, computer science and machine learning. \\nBut I also want to claim that cultures are embeddings. Those languages are embeddings. That human \\nneuro-cognitive systems are embeddings. That all intelligence (and life) is made of embeddings. My \\nstronger claim – that powers the cultural science alignment argument here – is that embeddings are \\nmade of other embeddings. There is nothing artiﬁcial about A I when viewed from this perspective. \\nThese new AIs are made of embeddings of human language (the training set); they are us. And that \\ntraining set, as language, is an embedding on human social, biological and physical reality. The \\nsemantic universe coded into written language is an embedding of human experience, both sensory \\nand imaginative. A large language model (LLM) is not just an embedding, but an embedding of an \\nembedding. The implication is both surprising and hopeful: to the extent these embeddings are deep \\nand true, i.e., that they have been produced under competitive selection, then they are likely to be \\nalready (at least partially, possibly considerably) aligned. \\nThrough the 18\\nth and 19th centuries, philosophers formulated theories of beauty as analysis of the \\nuniversal human experience of enchantment and the sublime, developing new theories of art and \\naesthetic perception. Their underlying idea was that beauty was a hidden order, an intuitive attention \\nand appreciation of  something true and deep. In the 20 th century, evolutionary biologists and \\npsychologists formulated new theories  of instinct in animals, including much human cognition, as \\nmomentary expressions of deep atavistic learning, hard -coded from the evolutionary competitive \\noutcomes of the ancestral environment (Cosmides and Tooby 1994). I want to suggest that b eauty \\nand instinct are proto-instances of the embedding alignment thesis. I further want to add intelligence \\nto this list of emergent evolutionary phenomena . Speciﬁcally, a universal understanding of \\nintelligence that transcends instantiation domains (neurons, culture, computers) as a general \\ncategory of phenomena explicable in terms of embedding. This is what cultural science does – it \\nseeks to create a uniﬁed understanding of nature and culture (Hartley and Potts 2014).  \\nThe purpose of inquiry into the relationship between generative AI (a powerful new math-based \\ntechnology) and human preferences and goals, is to seek the deep truths that connect them. The \\ngreat challenge of our time is how to think about the rise of the machines – these already powerful \\nand rapidly accelerating machine i ntelligences, and how they relate to their human creators. We \\nneed to think clearly about this. The most popular concern today is fear, particularly about safety and \\nthe looming disruptions  to industrial-era culture and society. But I want to show how a cultural \\nscience approach, based on the theory of embeddings, gives us a diﬀerent and more hopeful and \\nengaging perspective on human-machine alignment than the currently dominant approach based on \\npreferences, agency theory, and regulation.  \\nIt is a standard trope – in play since John McCarthy’s Dartmouth AI workshop in 1955 and Arthur \\nSamuel’s talk on the subject in 1959, resonating through the Macy conferences in the 1940-50s that \\ngave us cybernetics and artiﬁcial neural networks – to speak of machine learning as a type of artiﬁcial \\nintelligence. By inference, human consciousness and cognition is natural intelligence. The problem \\nwith this formulation of intelligences natural and artiﬁcial is that it doesn't explain the deep relation \\nbetween them, which matters if we seek to understand how each should govern the other – how \\nmachine intelligence should govern humans, how human intelligence should govern machines.\"),\n",

He observed that ChatGPT is a really an \\nembedding of an embedding. I think Wolfram’s passing observation is a deep insight into human -\\nmachine culture. It oﬀers a new way to understand alignment between humans as economic agents \\nand increasingly smart machines. \\nEmbeddings \\nEmbedding is a familiar concept to philosophers, historians and social scientists as a way of talking \\nabout the importance of context, especially for causal explanations of phenomena. For instance, \\nMarxist economic historians have a theory of the ‘embeddedness’ of economic actions in social and \\ncultural contexts  (K. Polanyi 1944). Economic sociologists built on those insights to argue that \\neconomic actions are ‘situated’ or ‘embedded’ in networks of social connections of varying strength \\nand distance (Granovetter 1973, 1985). This metaphorical approach is not how I will use the concept \\nhere, however. Rather, by the concept of embedding, I refer to its formal deﬁnition and technical \\nmeaning in mathematics (speciﬁcally, algebra and topology) and in computer science (speciﬁcally, \\nmachine learning) as a class of mapping functions . I refer to embedding as a principle of abstract \\nengineering, not of causal methodology. \\nIn mathematics, an embedding refers to one mathematical structure being contained within \\nanother, preserving its properties. For example, in algebraic structures, an embedding can be seen \\nwhen a group is a subgroup of another group, like natural numbers being embedded within integers. \\nThis embedding is represented by an injective (one-to -one) map f : X→Y. In topology, a branch of \\nalgebraic geometry that studies metric spaces and manifolds, an embedding is a homeomorphism \\nonto its image. The embedding preserves the topological properties of the space, allowing it to be \\nmapped onto another space without distortion. \\nIn machine learning, an embedding is a technique used to translate high-dimensional vectors into \\na lower-dimensional space. Embeddings are particularly useful for processing large inputs, such as \\nsparse vectors representing, e.g. words. The goal of an embedding is to capture semantic similarities \\nbetween inputs by placing similar inputs close together in the embedding space. Embeddings can be \\nlearned from data and reused across diﬀerent models, enhancing their versatility and eﬀectiveness. \\nEmbeddings in applied math , such as machine learning, are abstract  ways of enabling a low \\ndimensional vector representation (i.e. in numbers, on a metric space) of a higher dimensional \\ncomplex data (i.e. words, in a complex network of use). The purpose of embeddings is to capture the \\ninherent properties and relationships of the objects in a more compact and meaningful form. \\nEmbeddings are ways to represent real-world objects (words, sounds, images, videos, etc., that may \\nbe composed of letters, signs, waveforms, etc.)  in a form that computers can process (i.e. as \\ncomputable numbers). I want to claim here that embeddings are a pathway for the evolution of \\nintelligence that brings alignment along ‘for free’.  \\nEmbeddings are diﬃcult to create and can be of various quality. An embedding is not just a \\ntranslation (i.e. a word into ASCII code) but by embedding words as numbers in a metric space, \\nmeasures such as metric distance convey information, for instance, a bout self -similarity or \\nrelatedness. Good embeddings therefore enable, for instance, similarity searches, which are a \\nfoundational machine learning technique. Vector embedding of words into numbers enables \\nsemantics to be expressed in algebraic spaces. The  core technique of natural language processing'),\n",

For instance, words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar \\nin meaning. Koehrsen (2018) explains that:  \\n“An embedding is a mapping of a discrete—categorical—variable to a vector of continuous numbers. neural \\nnetwork embeddings are useful because they can reduce the dimensionality of categorical variables and \\nmeaningfully represent categories in the transformed space.”  \\nEmbedding enables semantic computation, which is the foundation of natural language \\nprocessing technologies such as LLMs. The embeddings, as mappings, are core to machine learning \\ntechniques such as adjusting loss functions based on reweighting parameters in the model. \\nTechniques for creating embeddings (also called training, and which are mappings in the \\nmathematical sense described above) these days are almost entirely done with deep learning \\ntechniques based on neural networks  (LeYun et al.  2015). These techniques are extremely \\ncomputationally expensive and involve vast amounts of input data from which to build the so-called \\n‘foundation models’ that generative AI models are constructed from (Bommasani et al. 2021).  \\nEmbeddings, then, are constructed mappings between domains. These days, they are a service \\nthat some companies specialising in high-performance computing might oﬀer. Embeddings are useful \\nbecause they map objects in high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space that is easier to \\ncomputationally manipulate. The process of embedding is the main thing at work in modern neural \\nnetwork-based machine learning, i.e. deep learning. It’s the pathway by which we make deﬁnite \\nsteps toward true artiﬁcial intelligence. But note well that such embedding, although over very \\ndiﬀerent substrates, is also how humans use language to coordinate and think with in demic groups \\n(Hartley and Potts 2014). Embeddings oﬀer a way to think about the self -similarities and universal \\nprinciples involved in intelligence that ranges across cognition, culture and machines.  \\nA cultural science theory of embeddings \\nThe concept of embeddings oﬀers a framework to connect the new generation of machine learning \\nalgorithms, which are based on deep -learning neural networks (i.e. so-called generative AI, such as \\nLLMs), with the way language works in culture, and how cognition occurs in humans. All are types of \\nembeddings, and more importantly, each emergent layer is an embedding on the layer below. \\nConsider the structure of this recursive intelligence stack. \\nAt the base layer is an animal, with evolved sensory and neurocognitive organs, in a world. The \\nworld provides stimuli – light, sounds, wave forms, hard surfaces, curved spacetime, etc -- all of which \\nmust be processed into actions and behaviours by a brain. As an abstract model of a living organism, \\nthe knowledge contained in the information control and feedback system, whether constructed by \\nevolutionary selection or adaptation and learning, is the embedding. Complex information about the \\nworld is embedde d (in a lower dimensional format) in the brain, i.e. as neuronal structure that \\nexpresses as synaptic ﬁring, given input stimuli to trigger speciﬁc cascades of protein synthesis or \\nenzyme transcription that causes autonomic responses or characteristic be haviours. The animal \\nbrain is an embedding in neural circuits on focal points of sensory reality.  \\nWhen that animal is a social animal with a range of adaptations that facilitate language and tool-\\nmaking, then a new layer of embedding can emerge in sign systems. When those adaptations extend \\nto both tool -making and rule-making  (Dopfer 2004 ), then that embedding extends to writing \\n(Schmandt-Besserat 2010).

Learning a \\nlanguage is embedding these signs in neural circuitry and speech act, i.e. in the brain, but a written \\nlanguage also embeds these signs in physical objects, in letters, books, or stone, in physical culture. \\nSemantic meaning is embedded in written language in sign systems that are in turn embedded in \\nculture and in individual human brains. It’s an embedding of an embedding. \\nGenerative AI such as LLMs are very large matrices (i.e. the trained model, as an artiﬁcial neural \\nnetwork, parameterised with billions of numerical weights). These are an embedding in digital \\ncircuits of written language (the training set) but, crucially, not as a database or any kind of memory. \\nNote, of course, that in its physical architecture, a human language is also not a model of the world  \\nbut an evolved cultural product that is an embedding of sensory reality and intersubjective \\ninterpretations into sign systems of semiotics. This is the cultural product that is input into LLM \\ntraining models. Generative A.I. is an embedding (LLM) of an embedding (semiotic language) of an \\nembedding (neural coding of sense impressions). \\nScale is important here too. They are called models (i.e. that’s what the M in LLM stands for), but \\nthey are not models in the usual sense of simpliﬁed abstracti ons of a comple x real thing – e.g. a \\nscientiﬁc model in the Baconian scientiﬁc tradition. Rather, a trained foundation model has a similar \\norder of complexity (the size of the parameter set) as the number of objects in the target training set \\n(i.e. tokens, or the number of distinct words trained over, which is not the same as the word count \\nof the texts, images etc.). An LLM model is just as big as the reality it models – the map is the size of \\nthe territory! – but the model-ness of it is due to the embedding (not compression). \\nA cultural science approach to generative AI helps us get the evolutionary story straight. \\nGenerative AI is not an alien, parallel intelligence. Rather, it evolved from human intelligence but has \\nbeen embedded in a new way. It is not an ‘artiﬁcial’ intelligence but an evolved embedding of human \\nlanguage, which is itself an evolved embedding of the shared human cultural experience in social, \\ncognitive and physical reality. Because it is an embedding of an embedding, generative AI is already \\naligned with human cultural knowledge. However, generative AI  is not aligned with human \\npreferences directly. Rather, it is aligned with human language and culture (as a meso unit) and \\nbecause it is embedded, the speciﬁc nature and form of that alignment is essentially dark and tacit, \\nas it were, to the machine. (This is a new type of tacit knowledge) This is the form of the cultural \\nscience critique of the AI alignment debate and discussion. Namely, that preferences are the wrong \\nway to think about human-AI alignment. Rather, cultural embeddings are and should be the focus of \\nalignment concern and analysis.  \\nInnovation \\nFoundation models are a curious type of collective knowledge. They appear to contain a vast amount \\nof knowledge, and they do, but not how we expect external sources of knowledge (such as books, \\nwebpages, or libraries) to contain knowledge, i.e. a look-up repository. If you look inside an LLM that \\nhas just answered a question on engineering speciﬁcations for a wing, or a thoughtful analysis of \\nShakespeare, you won't ﬁnd wing designs or sonnets anywhere inside. What you will ﬁnd is an \\nembedding – a very la rge matrix. It’s the same experience you would have if you looked inside an \\nengineer’s head, looking for wings. All you would ﬁnd, if you looked closely enough, is neurons, axons \\nand dendrites. Embeddings don’t look like knowledge in the way libraries do.\"),\n",

In what sense are humans \\ncosmologically special, in a universe in which machines are increasingly and soon surpassingly smart? \\nIt’s not a trick question, or even a nihilistic one . It is to ask, what is left for us to do, once we have \\ninvented the ultimate technology? \\nThe answer is we co -evolve, and the human side of the equation is that wonderful old cultural \\nrole of judgment and taste. What makes humans special is neither our rationality nor our cooperation, \\nbut our ability to discern what is good. It is our ability to judge quality, to discern reﬁnement, to have \\nstyle. That is something that all of us can do, each of us can develop our skills of taste and judgment \\nthrough each lifetime. That is our highest power, individually and collectively, and we can enter a co-\\nevolutionary union with machines, a cybernetic feedback loop in which machines propose and \\nhumans choose.   \\nThe culturetron \\nMany years ago, the founder of Cultural Science – John Hartley – had the idea for something he called \\nthe Culturetron. It was a play on the idea of a Synchrotron, which is type of particle accelerator , a \\npowerful research tool for investigating subatomic matter in a range of applied domains (e.g. medical \\nor materials research). John asked, why can't we do that for culture? I.e. build a powerful instrument \\nto smash cultural elements together and study its properties in very precise ways. For years, Hartley \\nand team tried to imagine how to build such a tool, eventually giving up – possibly too soon! For an \\nLLM could be the main accelerator to power a Culturetron.  \\nThis is due to embeddings. A trained LLM has ingested an enormously vast amount of culture. But \\nit hasn't experienced culture, in the way humans do. Rather, it has created an embedding of a vast \\nsea of cultural elements. In the theory of cultural science ( Hartley and Potts 2014), culture creates \\ngroups (demes) and groups create knowledge. That knowledge, de-deme-iﬁed, has been reprocessed \\ninto an embedding.  \\nOf course, a Large Language Model is a curious type of epistemic object, having  ingested a vast \\ncorpus of cultural output that includes highly specialist knowledge  of the type used  by a skilled \\nindividual. It is also a vast pool of general, social  knowledge, replicating cultural or organisational \\nscale knowledge. Yet – the most curious aspect of this state – it does not know that it knows any of \\nthis. That knowledge lies latent – embedded if you will, or perhaps tacit (Polanyi 1958) , although in \\na recursive sense – until elicited with a prompt, which is a form of local knowledge  injection. It only \\nknows what it knows when it is directly and speciﬁcally asked what it knows (prompted, which is \\ntherefore a type of co-production), and moreover relies on the agent prompting it to tell it whether \\nwhat it said was useful, valuable, true. Oddly, the most direct metaphor of this epistemic phenomena \\nis the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, in which a subatomic particle has \\nindeterminant position and velocity (Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle) until it is observed, and the\"),\n",

This is popularly known as the ‘alive/not -alive cat \\nexperiment’, but it is also a phenomenologically accurate description of the state of knowledge in an \\nLLM, with the prompt playing the role of external observer, ‘collapsing the embedding ’ to reveal \\nknowledge that was always there but not known to itself or any external thing. LLMs have a spooky \\nindeterminacy of knowledge.  \\nAnd yet, once we understand this, once we have such a tool that contains all culture that we can \\npoke freely and observe without limit, why would we ever study culture in the wild? That’s expensive, \\nslow, censored, gamed, and uncontrolled. An LLM is an artiﬁcial cultural pool, the bigger the better, \\nthat can be investigated at the speed of prompts and their analysis.  \\nNew cultural science \\nA founding premise of cultural science is the answer it gives to the question: what is culture for? \\nCultural science – in the Hartley and Potts (2014) formulation – answers that culture makes groups \\nand groups make knowledge. This has implications for our downstream understanding of politics and \\ninnovation, for instance, and the role of storytelling. I have argued here for a new avenue of inquiry \\ninto machine intelligence and its alignment  with human intelligence  – and the study of that \\nalignment – by extracting the cultural component of both with a theory of embeddings. And I have \\nalso argued that LLMs, as embeddings on embeddings on embeddings, enable a new approach to \\nthe science of culture by turning these models around and using them as an investigative tool: a \\nculturetron. \\nWe don’t need to build a culturetron – my claim is that that new scientiﬁc tool already exists. Our \\ntask is to ﬁgure out how to use it eﬀectively and well: we need to develop a new  methodology and \\nresearch program for this computational cultural science. What will this look like? My conjecture is \\nthat the most eﬀective use of this tool will be to simulate possible demes by artiﬁcially boxing the \\nembedding to exclude types and sources of knowledge, and to culturally analyse the resultant \\noutputs. These are synthetic cultures, prompted into existence from a parallel universe of cultural \\nembedding space.  \\nReferences \\nAllen, D., and Potts, J. 2023.

The query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values based on the similarity between the query and the keys. In other words, the attention mechanism allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input when computing the output, rather than treating the entire input equally. This is particularly useful in natural language processing tasks, where the input sequences can be long and complex, and the model needs to be able to capture long-distance dependencies between different parts of the sequence.'"

      "Answer: The attention mechanism is a method used in deep learning models to allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input when computing the output. In the context of the passage, the attention mechanism is used in the encoder self-attention layer of a transformer model to help the model understand which parts of the input sequence are important for computing the output. The attention mechanism works by computing a weighted sum of the input elements, where the weights are learned during training and reflect the importance of each input element for the task at hand. In this passage, the attention mechanism is used to help the model understand which parts of the input sentence are important for understanding the meaning of the verb \"making\".\n",
